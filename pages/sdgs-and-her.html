              The World Bank and the Wharton School’s Zicklin Center for 
              Business Ethics Research, in collaboration with UN Women and 
              UNDP, have embarked on an innovative partnership to launch the 
              SDGs&Her initiative. This initiative is an online competition 
              that honors outstanding women micro-entrepreneurs who are 
              supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
              (SDGs). The Zicklin Center also promotes knowledge, capacity 
              development, and awareness about the SDGs (particularly 
              concerning their impact on women), while working closely with 
              private sector partners to share best practices and innovative 
              ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top winners will receive leadership training, mentoring, 
              and will be recognized at an event during the April 2020 World 
              Bank & IMF Spring Meetings in Washington DC and our participants’ 
              accomplishments and ideas will be shared prominently on social 
              media.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is our hope that with the involvement of the Zicklin Center 
              and our partners, SDGs&Her will significantly support women 
              micro-entrepreneurs all around the world. In the process, we hope 
              that the best ideas from global debates will be more productively 
              channeled to address the challenges that women micro-entrepreneurs
              face.
