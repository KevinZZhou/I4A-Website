              <h3> Giving Young Leaders a Voice in the Global Development 
                Conversation</h3>
              <p>Ideas for Action provides students and young professionals from around 
                the world with a unique opportunity to help shape the international 
                development agenda and to take an active role in changing the world.</p>
              <p>A joint program of the World Bank Group and the Zicklin Center for 
                Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School, Ideas for Action is a 
                knowledge platform connecting young leaders all around the world who 
                are passionate about the future development of our world.</p>
              <p>We host an annual competition during which youths from around the 
                world design ideas for financing the UN’s new development agenda. The 
                competition acts as a catalyst to spark global conversation among 
                millenials and seeks to encourage them to contribute their own voice to 
                the development conversation.</p>
