      <h3> Announcing the 2020 Ideas for Action Competition </h3>
      <p>The World Bank Group and the Zicklin Center at Wharton are pleased to 
        host the 2020 Ideas for Action (I4A) competition, which engages young 
        people (18-35 years old) to develop innovative solutions in support of 
        the implementation of the SDGs ( https://ideas4action.org ). Note that 
        the Competition Guidelines for 2020 will mirror those for 2019 
        ( https://ideas4action.org/2019-competition/). <br>
        Additionally, please note that <b>the deadline for submission has been 
        extended to March 22nd, 2020.</b> In 2019, we received 3,100 applications 
        from 142 countries and territories, and more than 7,000 registered teams, 
        Due to the increased interest, we are moving to a new platform for 
        registration and applications submission, which will be available in the 
        second half of November. <br> <br>

        <h3> The Sustainable Development Goals </h3>
        <p>On September 25, 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a new set of 
        global development goals. All member countries are now using these 
        objectives to frame their development agendas and political policies 
        over the next 15 years. <br>
        Youth engagement throughout the design and implementation of the 
        SDGs through innovative ideas is critical for their success. </p>
