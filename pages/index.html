      <h3> Giving Young Leaders a Voice in the Global Development

      <p>Ideas for Action provides students and young professionals from around 
        the world with a unique opportunity to help shape the international 
        development agenda and to take an active role in changing the world.</p>
      <p>A joint program of the World Bank Group and the Zicklin Center for 
        Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School, Ideas for Action is a 
        knowledge platform connecting young leaders all around the world who

      <p>We host an annual competition during which youths from around the 
        world design ideas for financing the UNâ€™s new development agenda. The 
        competition acts as a catalyst to spark global conversation among 
        millenials and seeks to encourage them to contribute their own voice to 
        the development conversation.</p>

        Additionally, please note that <b>the deadline for submission has been 
        extended to March 22nd, 2020.</b> In 2019, we received 3,100 applications 
        from 142 countries and territories, and more than 7,000 registered teams,
